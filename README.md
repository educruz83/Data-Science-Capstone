# Coursera Data Science Capstone Project
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

This repository includes:

* Shiny app R files
* RStudio presenter files.

Regarding Shiny App, link is: https://educruz83.shinyapps.io/Capstone/

Please find the slide desk in the following link: http://rpubs.com/educ1983/courseradatasciencecapstone 

Finally, source code and presentation files are available on GitHub: https://github.com/educruz83/Data-Science-Capstone
